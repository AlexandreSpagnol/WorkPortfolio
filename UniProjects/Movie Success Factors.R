#nevertheless, the lowest values in terms of gross income coincide with the dump months
#(january,february,august and september) and the higher income values coincide with the months
#usually associated to be more profitable (july and november). 

##Correlation identification
#eventhough release_month is numerical, it represents months and as such is an 
#ordinal variable so we wont include it in the correlation matrix

#we have metascore and imdb_score with 0.67 and votes_imdb and budget with 0.65
#as such votes_imdb and imdb_score will be dropped
#we will preserve metascore over imdb_score since it encompasses a bigger scale of 
#movie rating and as such we will assume it as being more precise
#we will preserve budget over votes_imdb since the last doesnt provide that much valuable
#information

##RAMSEY TEST for misspecification assessment

reset_movies 

#brief explanation:When you call resettest(movies_model3), it automatically adds squared 
#and cubed terms of the fitted values to the model, and then tests whether these 
#additional terms are jointly significant.
#In this situation since pvalue>0.05 so there is not enough evidence to 
#conclude that your model is misspecified.
#In practical terms, this means that the original linear model appears to be adequately 
#specified, and there is no strong evidence suggesting the need for additional nonlinear 
#terms. 

##zero conditional mean assessment
#we will implement t-test on the mean of residuals to test if it is significantly 
#different from zero, by first storing all residuals in variable residuals.
residuals <- residuals(movies_model3, type = "response", robust = "HC1")

residual_test <- t.test(residuals)

#since pvalue>0.05  there is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis
#that the true mean of the residuals is zero. Therefore, we have indication of the validatity of 
#the assumption of a zero conditional mean, indicating that, on average, the residuals are 
#centered around zero.
