# About me
Hey there, I'm Alexandre, a 23-year-old graduate student diving deep into the fascinating world of data science at Nova IMS. With a background in Business Management from Universidade do Algarve, I'm currently honing my skills in Data Science and Advanced Analytics, with a focus on Business Analytics.

But hey, life isn't all about academics for me. When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away, you can probably find me on the open road, fueled by my passion for all things motor and wheels. I thrive on the thrill of learning and constantly seek out new courses to expand my knowledge and expertise.

What drives me, you ask? Well, it's the relentless curiosity about how information shapes our world. That's what drew me to data science â€“ the power to unravel the mysteries hidden within raw data and turn them into game-changing insights. I'm on a mission to decode the secrets of data and marry them with the intricacies of business, all in pursuit of making smarter, more informed decisions that shape the future.
